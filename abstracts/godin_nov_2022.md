This talk introduces concepts of extreme value theory (EVT) which are then used to estimate the tail distribution (in particular the CVaR risk measure) of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables when observations lying in the tail are scarce. Such scarcity tends to occur when considering a CVaR confidence level that is very high. A novel de-biasing scheme to improve the CVaR EVT-based estimator is presented. Its application to a risk-aware multi-armed bandits is illustrated. Finally, ideas for inclusion of EVT-based CVaR estimators within full blown risk-aware Markov Decision Problems are discussed. 

This talk draws ideas from the following joint works with Dylan Troop (Concordia) and Jia Yuan Yu (Amazon, previously Concordia):
